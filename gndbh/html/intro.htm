  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">The NANDBH 2004 CD contains data of more than
  3500 active NDBs located throughout North, Central and South America,
  the Caribbean and the Pacific. Many of the more
          frequently heard transatlantic NDBs have been included, as well
          as NDBs operating from offshore installations such as oil platforms.
          Moreover the CD lists widely reported unidentified beacons and
          irregular call signs which result from so-called "negative keying".
          Many a NDB mystery may be solved with this kind of information on hand.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">I always enjoy receiving direct
  input from active NDB DXers, so just feel free to send me your latest
  observations.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Enjoy your beacon DXing :-)</font></p>
